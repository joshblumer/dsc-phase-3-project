# Phase 3 Project

Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table Competition, Hosted by DrivenData

## Introduction

An exploratory data analysis of Tanzanian water well data collected by Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water and provided by [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/) 
My goal in this analysis is to extract insight from patterns in the dataset and model them using classification techniques to predict whether a given well is functional or not. 
Being able to predict the condition of water wells is an important facet of preventative maintainance in order to provide clean water to as many Tanzanian people as possible. 

## Technologies
* There are several Jupyter Notebooks found in this repo that contain the data analysis and modeling used in this project and they were created using Python 3.7.6
* There is a keynote presentation for non-technical audiences available under the file name "Phase3Presentation.pdf"

### Necessary libraries to reproduce and run this project are:

* Pandas 
* NumPy
* MatPlotLib
* Seaborn
* SciPy
* DateTime
* SKLearn
* StatsModels

## Objectives

* Explore and analyze dataset using visualizations to identify outliers and feature distributions among the target variable
* Clean data by removing or imputing missing or null values and changing any necessary data types 
* Analyze independent variables for the strongest possible variance among distribution of the target variable
* Engineer features in order to be processed and modeled by classification techniques using feature scaling and one-hot encoding
* Model dependent/independent variable relationship iteratively using different classification techniques
* Validate model performance and ability to predict well functionality 

## Methodology

There are many classification techniques available to data scientists and choosing the most suitable technique given the dataset you're modeling directly impacts the results and ability to deploy the model and use it in a real world setting.
